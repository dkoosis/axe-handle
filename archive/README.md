![Axe Handle Logo](assets/axe-handle-100x100.svg)

## What is Axe Handle?

Axe Handle generates Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers from your schema definitions. It creates clean, optimized TypeScript code that follows MCP protocols, letting you focus on your application logic instead of protocol details.

## Key Features

- **Schema-driven generation** - Define your API once, generate server code automatically
- **TypeScript-first** - Get type safety and modern language features
- **Extensible design** - Add custom logic where you need it
- **MCP compliance** - Implements the protocol correctly so you don't have to worry about it
- **Developer experience** - Clear errors, helpful documentation, and sensible defaults

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
npm install -g axe-handle

# Generate a server from your schema
axe-handle generate --schema your-schema.proto --output ./server
```

## Why MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how AI applications communicate with their context. It lets you:

- Connect AI models to your data and services
- Create reusable components that work with any MCP-compatible client
- Build complex AI workflows by connecting multiple MCP servers

## FAQ

### Why "Axe Handle"?

The name comes from Gary Snyder's poem ["Axe Handles"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/57150/axe-handles), which explores the idea that tools create other tools, and knowledge passes from person to person:

> "One afternoon the last week in April  
> Showing Kai how to throw a hatchet  
> One-half turn and it sticks in a stump.  
> He recalls the hatchet-head  
> Without a handle, in the shop  
> And go gets it, and wants it for his own.  
> A broken-off axe handle behind the door  
> Is long enough for a hatchet,  
> We cut it to length and take it  
> With the hatchet head  
> And working hatchet, to the wood block."

Like the poem's metaphor of crafting tools to make other tools, Axe Handle creates servers that help build better AI applications.
