# Axe Handle Project

<!-- Path: README.md -->
<!-- Purpose: Top-level project overview and documentation index to help developers navigate the codebase -->

Axe Handle is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server reference implementation in Golang, which I'm doing as a learning exercise and foundation for future work. The server does nothing but connect to MCP client Claude Desktop, and perform "hello world" level responses.
