# Axe Handle Project Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Axe Handle project, combining immediate tasks, technical improvements, and future enhancements.

## Immediate Tasks

### Environment and Build System
- Standardize TypeScript Configuration
  - Use TypeScript 5.1.6 for compatibility with all tools
  - Set up consistent tsconfig.json across project components
- Set Up Comprehensive Linting
  - Configure ESLint with typescript-eslint and appropriate rules
  - Add complexity rules to enforce cyclomatic complexity limits
  - Set up Prettier for code formatting
  - Add proper exclusion for the generated/ directory in .eslintignore
  - Create separate linting configuration for generated code
- Establish Testing Framework
  - Set up Vitest for unit and integration testing
  - Create initial test structure and examples

### Code Organization and Standards
- Standardize Path Headers
  - Ensure all source files have proper `// Path: [filepath]` headers
  - Automate path header validation in CI pipeline
- Implement Directory Structure According to Rules
  - Organize files by feature, not by type (Rule 2)
  - Consolidate utility functions into feature-specific modules
- Refactor File Names for Clarity
  - Replace generic names with specific ones (Rule 1)
  - Ensure filenames are concise but descriptive

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- Address Circular Dependencies
  - Review and eliminate circular imports
  - Improve module boundaries
- Consolidate Duplicate Utilities
  - Identify and merge duplicate functionality across codebase
  - Create shared utilities for common operations

### Documentation
- Improve API Documentation
  - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public interfaces
  - Document business rules and edge cases
- Implement Standardized Error Handling
  - Create error class hierarchy with categorized error codes
  - Implement consistent error boundaries
  - Document common error patterns and best practices
  - Develop error code registry with explanations

## Future Enhancements

### Performance and Architecture
- Improve Tree Shaking
  - Optimize code for better tree shaking (Rule 23)
  - Review and reduce bundle size
- Enhance Error Handling
  - Implement consistent error handling patterns (Rule 26)
  - Improve error messages and logging

### Testing and Quality Assurance
<!-- These items are confirmed as still relevant and desired -->
- Add Test Coverage Checks
  - Implement minimum test coverage requirements
  - Create comprehensive test suite
- Add Complexity Metrics
  - Set up SonarCloud for deeper code quality analysis
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow to run SonarCloud analysis
  - Add visualization of complexity trends over time
- Add Continuous Integration
  - Run checks in CI pipeline
  - Automate build validation

## Project Expansion

<!-- These expansion plans are confirmed as accurate and desired -->
- Support Additional Target Frameworks
  - Explore beyond Express.js for generated servers
  - Consider support for other runtime environments
- Input Format Extensions
  - Support for alternative schema definition formats beyond Protocol Buffers
  - Add schema migration and versioning tools
- Enhanced Code Generation Features
  - Add customization options for generated code
  - Support for different architectural patterns in generated servers

## Documentation Improvements

### Immediate Documentation Tasks
- Review editorial notes in consolidated documents and make decisions
- Delete or archive redundant documentation files
- Complete skeleton documents that need more detailed content
- Update existing documentation references to point to new structure

### Documentation Expansion
- Create a comprehensive Getting Started guide
- Add contribution guidelines (possibly as CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Develop user tutorials with examples
- Document the release process in the Development Workflow guide
