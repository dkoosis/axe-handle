## Project Vision

Axe Handle is a code generator for creating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. It bridges the gap between existing services and AI agents by enabling seamless integration through the MCP standard. The generator takes a service definition (Protocol Buffer schema) as input and produces a TypeScript/Express.js implementation of an MCP-compliant server.

## Current Focus

Our immediate focus is on establishing a stable, functioning build environment before proceeding with feature development. For specific actionable tasks, see [TODO.md](./TODO.md) or check our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dkoosis/axe-handle/issues).

The current critical areas are:
- Fixing build validation tools
- Standardizing on pnpm for package management
- Ensuring proper ESLint configuration 
- Establishing consistent code quality standards

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- Address Circular Dependencies
  - Review and eliminate circular imports
  - Improve module boundaries
- Maintain Simple Directory Structure
  - Avoid creating directories with only one file
  - Keep organization practical rather than theoretical
  - Directories should contain related files that serve a common purpose
- Apply Consistent Standards
  - Standardize coding patterns across all utilities
  - Gradually convert JavaScript files to TypeScript where appropriate
  - Ensure all utilities follow project coding standards

### Documentation
- Improve API Documentation
  - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all public interfaces
  - Document business rules and edge cases
- Implement Standardized Error Handling
  - Create error class hierarchy with categorized error codes
  - Implement consistent error boundaries
  - Document common error patterns and best practices
  - Develop error code registry with explanations

## Future Enhancements

### Performance and Architecture
- Improve Tree Shaking
  - Optimize code for better tree shaking
  - Review and reduce bundle size
- Enhance Error Handling
  - Implement consistent error handling patterns
  - Improve error messages and logging

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- Add Test Coverage Checks
  - Implement minimum test coverage requirements
  - Create comprehensive test suite
- Add Complexity Metrics
  - Set up SonarCloud for deeper code quality analysis
  - Create GitHub Actions workflow to run SonarCloud analysis
  - Add visualization of complexity trends over time
- Add Continuous Integration
  - Run checks in CI pipeline
  - Automate build validation

## Project Expansion

- Support Additional Target Frameworks
  - Explore beyond Express.js for generated servers
  - Consider support for other runtime environments
- Input Format Extensions
  - Support for alternative schema definition formats beyond Protocol Buffers
  - Add schema migration and versioning tools
- Enhanced Code Generation Features
  - Add customization options for generated code
  - Support for different architectural patterns in generated servers

## Release Planning

### v0.1 (Initial Release)
- Core functionality for generating Express.js servers from Protobuf schemas
- Basic MCP protocol compliance
- Command-line interface for generation
- Documentation for getting started

### v0.2 (Quality Improvements)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Improved template system
- Enhanced validation of input schemas
- Test coverage for critical components

### v0.3 (Feature Expansion)
- Support for additional frameworks
- Customization options for generated code
- Schema migration tools
- API for programmatic usage

## For Code Assistants

When working on the Axe Handle project, be mindful of the following guidelines. For more detailed information, see our [Code Standards](./CODE_STANDARDS.md) and [Development Guide](./DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md):

- **Error Handling**: Uses the Result pattern from neverthrow instead of throwing exceptions
- **Header Systems**: 
  - Path Headers: Every source file must begin with `// Path: path/to/file.ts`
  - JSDoc Headers: Complex files should have JSDoc-style file headers with @file, @description, etc.
- **Code Organization**: 
  - Files are organized by feature, not by type
  - Avoid creating directories with only one file
  - Keep organization simple and practical
- **Templates**: Uses Eta templating engine with a specific directory structure
- **Style Guide**: Follow TypeScript best practices defined in `docs/CODE_STANDARDS.md`
- **Package Management**: Use pnpm exclusively, not npm or yarn

Before modifying any file, please review the relevant sections in `docs/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md` and existing code patterns in similar files. When adding new features, follow the established module boundaries and separation of concerns.
